Title: 112 Bowl
Project Description:
I made a two-player football game, where each players can choose a team and play a game. When on offense, the user uses the mouse to control where to throw the ball, and on defense, the user can switch between defenders.

How To Run:
There is only one .py file, 112bowl.py, so run this to run the project. Also note that there are some issues with loading csv data if the zip file is not extracted.

Commands:
Player 1 uses WASD, player 2 uses the arrow keys for movements, or TFGH, which is a feature since some of my arrow keys do not work, and whoever is on defense uses the B key to switch between the defenders.

Libraries:
The only external library this app uses is cmu_graphics

Fonts:
This app uses no custom fonts.
